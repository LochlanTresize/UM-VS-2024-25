# Poster
See [./poster.pdf]

I learnt a lot about how to write a poster when I was presenting this one at the end of the program. Making mine more readable by cutting a column off and focusing on the results and intepretations, rather than obfuscating with equations and logic like I have done would be better. When I was presenting I had a sort of elevator pitch I would go through with people and I would now write a poster to elaborate on such a pitch. If I find time I might make a poster V2 based on these learnings, but as Huxley said sometimes you just have to move on.


# Notes/Report
The scholarship centered around the poster, so I didn't write an accompanying report (or organise my notes into something resembling one). This is something I am working on at the moment and I'll be sure to put it here when I have something I'm happy with. One of the goals of my project was to document an give an expose of some of the techniques used in analysing sols to the KGE (particuarly the methods of stationary phase and Hankel functions), so I am pretty keen on getting these written up sometime in the winter break.
